# Website Redesign & Structure Plan

Goal:
- Transform my affiliate marketing website (for solar kits) into a more content-driven and conversion-focused platform.
- Current pages: Homepage, Contact, Product (Shop), About.
- Adding: Blog page.

Tasks for Claude:
1. Update **Homepage**:
   - Keep Hero section with main solar energy value proposition + CTA.
   - Add a short "Why Solar?" section explaining benefits (SEO-rich copy).
   - Add a "Featured Guides / Blog Posts" section: 3–4 latest or most valuable blog posts in card layout (image, title, short excerpt, read more).
   - Add a "Top Picks" product section: 3–4 affiliate products (with Amazon/Aliexpress buttons), linking to the full **Shop** page.
   - Retain Newsletter signup and Footer.
   - Ensure homepage balances education + conversion (content first, products second).

2. Create **Blog Page**:
   - Blog index page with card layout (like https://profitise.com/blog/):
     - Grid of posts (2–3 columns desktop, 2 columns tablet, 1 column mobile).
     - Each card: featured image, title, metadata (date/category), excerpt, "Read More" link.
   - Single blog post template:
     - Large featured image.
     - Clear headings, readable font size, social sharing buttons.
     - "Recommended Products" section at the end with affiliate links.
     - Related posts section (2–3 cards).
   
3. Keep **Shop Page** (Product listing) as the full affiliate grid.
   - Showcase all products with category filters.
   - Each product card should link out with affiliate buttons (Amazon, Aliexpress).

4. Navigation:
   - Update navbar to: Home | Blog | Shop | About | Contact
   - Add search bar (optional but recommended for blogs).

5. SEO & Conversion Enhancements:
   - Add metadata structure for blog posts (title, description, keywords).
   - Optimize images with alt text.
   - Ensure CTA buttons are consistent (color, hover state, placement).
   - Include newsletter signup box on blog sidebar or at bottom of posts.

Constraints:
- Do NOT copy logos or branding from reference sites (Sunrun, Profitise).
- Use them for **design/style/layout inspiration only**.
- Ensure the blog content and product recommendations remain unique to my site.

Deliverables:
- Revise Homepage layout.
- Build Blog index and blog post template.
- Retain Shop, About, Contact pages.
- Update navigation across site.
- Provide updated TODO list of design + code changes.
